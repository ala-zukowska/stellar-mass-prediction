Luminosity: Total outgoing power radiated by a star. Usually expressed in solar luminosities (1 L_sun = 3.828 * 10^26 W).

Metallicity (Fe/H): Ratio of atoms of iron to atoms of hydrogen within a star. Expressed on a logarithmic scale. The metallicity of the Sun is approximately
-4.54, meaning that the ratio of iron to hydrogen is approximately 10^-4.54 in terms of individual atoms.

Mass: The mass of a star. Expressed in solar masses (1 M_sun = 1.99 * 10^30 kg).

Radius: The radius of a star. Expressed in solar radii (1 R_sun = 6.96 * 10^8 m).

Teff: The estimated surface temperature of a star derived from a black body approximation.

Spectral classsification: Classification of stars based on their surface temperature. The industry standard Harvard classification includes
the following classes (descending): O, B, A, F, G, K, M.

Main sequence star: A relatively stable star that produces energy through hydrogen fusion. This is the longest lasting phase
in a stellar life cycle.

Mass-luminosity relation: An empirically established relationship between the mass and luminosity of a main sequence star.
