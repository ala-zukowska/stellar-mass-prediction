Rocky planets, like our Earth, are key candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life because of their ability to support conditions necessary for life as we know it -- liquid
water, a stable atmosphere and a diverse chemical composition. Whether these planets form, become habitable, and when they do, remain habitable for long enough for life to emerge 
and evolve depends on the mass of the host star, which is associated with characteristics such as the intensity of ionizing radiation, known to be very damaging to most lifeforms
familiar to us, as well as the star's lifetime, which sets natural boundaries for the existence of potential life within its system. Accurately estimating the masses of a large 
number of stars is therefore of great importance in efficiently directing our search for life among the stars
